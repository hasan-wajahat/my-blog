# Container Queries

As the web has evolved, we have moved to using more and more components. Be it
frontend frameworks like React or Svelte, or templating languages like Laravel Blade;
all of them depend on the concept of components. These components can be used inside
dialogs, split-screens, or the main content area, meaning their size requirements can
vary widely. Luckily for us, CSS has caught up with this trend and has introduced a
new feature called Container Queries, which allows us to style components based on
their container size.

You may be wondering, ‚ÄúHasan, we already have media queries!‚Äù. And you are right, of
course, but media queries are based on the viewport size. Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if your
component could be aware of its container size and adjust accordingly? And all that
without a single line of JS? Now that I have your attention (hopefully), let‚Äôs dive in.

## When to use Container Queries

Below I am rendering a simple ManagerCard component that we use in bunch of places in [Sematext](https://sematext.com/).
This is a simplified (and cruder) version of the original component.

<ManagerCard />
<figcaption>
  With MDX I can render the component instead of using an image.
</figcaption>

The component can be rendered in different places on our site as shown below:

<figure>
  <Image src={inMainPageImage} alt="ManagerCard in main page" />
  <figcaption>ManagerCard in main page</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
  <Image src={inFlyoutImage} alt="ManagerCard in flyout" />
  <figcaption>ManagerCard in flyout</figcaption>
</figure>

Before I introduced container queries, we had to pass additional props like ‚Äúminimal‚Äù
to the component to adjust its sizing depending on where it was rendered. This could
become overly complex as we continued to add it in different places. This becomes worse
when you consider smaller screens like tablets.

But with container queries, it doesn‚Äôt matter where this component is used. It will
automatically adjust its styling based on the space available. This allows us to get
rid of the additional props and makes the component more reusable and easier to maintain.

## How to use Container Queries

Let‚Äôs see how we would use container queries to style the ManagerCard component.

```js
<div className="manager-card-container">
  <div className="manager-card">
    <h3>ManagerCard</h3>
    <p>Some content</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

To begin with we need to define a container and set the `container-type` property:

```css
.manager-card-container {
  container-type: inline-size;
  width: 100%;
}
```

The container-type property can have 3 possible values:

- `size`: Uses width and height of the container
- `inline-size`: Uses width of the container
- `normal`: The element is not a query container

We will explain in a little more detail what these values mean, but first,
let‚Äôs see how we use the query part of container queries.

```css
// default size
.manager-card {
  display: block;
}

// when the container is greater than 660px
@container (inline-size > 660px ) {
  .manager-card {
    display: flex;
  }
}
```

Just like media queries, we tell the browser to apply specific styles when the container size
is less or greater than a certain value. In this case, we are changing from block to flex when
the container is greater than 660px.

### Container Condition

Another added advantage of using container queries is that we can use a much more comfortable
syntax for our size conditionals. The min and max width syntax will also work, but I find
this new syntax more in line with the rest of our programming languages. Unlike media queries,
the container query rule set has a much more dynamic condition set. Here are a few neat examples
directly from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@container). I would highly
recommend the article to look at all available options.

```css
@container (width > 400px) and (height > 400px) {
  /* <stylesheet> */
}

@container (width > 400px) or (height > 400px) {
  /* <stylesheet> */
}

@container not (width < 400px) {
  /* <stylesheet> */
}
```

### Container Name

By default, the container query will apply styles based on the nearest parent with a
containment context. However, there may be times when you would like to control the
containment context that your container query is based on. For this, we can use the
container-name property.

```css
/* A single name */
container-name: managerCardContainer;

/* Multiple names */
container-name: managerCardContainer managerCardParent;

/* Using the container name */
@container managerCardContainer (inline-size > 660px ) {
  .manager-card {
    display: flex;
  }
}
```

You can also use shorthand for setting container name and type:

```css
.manager-card-container {
  container: managerCardContainer / inline-size;
}
```

## Container Query Gotchas

Container queries disable the ability of the element to obtain size information of the container
from its content. As soon as you define an element as a container, it will collapse, irrespective
of the content it has, unless you specify the width and height of the container explicitly.

This is where we revisit the `container-type` property. As we saw, we have three possible values for the
container type. We don‚Äôt care about the normal value as that is just the default for elements and
means we don‚Äôt have any container query size calculations for the container. The other two properties
allow us to access the magic of container queries. When using `container-type: size`, the queries can
check both the width and height of the element. This also means that we have to specify both the
width and height of the container.

In my experience, container-type: inline-size is the most useful one. For one thing, you only need to
specify the width of the container. And mostly for applying styles, I find that the width of the
container is more important than the height.

## Usage in TailwindCSS

If you are like me and love Tailwind, then you would be pleased to know that Tailwind also supports
container queries. This support is not out of the box, but there is an official plugin,
[tailwindcss-container-queries](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-container-queries),
that helps you write container queries today.

Here is how you would use it:

```html
<div class="@container">
  <div class="@lg:flex">
    <!-- Makes the div a flexbox when the container is larger than `32rem` -->
  </div>
</div>
```

## Browser Support

Well, the good news does not end here! Container queries are now supported in all major browsers,
and you can safely use them in production sites today.

  <Image src={browserSupport} alt="Can I use container queries" />
  <figcaption>Browser Support for Container Queries</figcaption>
</figure>

## Conclusion

Container queries are one of the best features that have been added to CSS in recent years.
They fit so well with the component architecture of the web today. Not only are they easy to use,
but they also have great browser support today! So go out and give it a try üöÄ.
