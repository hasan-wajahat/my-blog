# Container Queries

As the web has evolved, we have moved to using more and more components. Be it 
Frontend frameworks like React or Svelte, or templating languages like laravel Blade; all of them
depend on the concept of components. These components can be used inside dialogs, split-screens or 
the main content area, meaning their size requirements can vary widely. Luckily for us, CSS has
caught up with this trend and has introduced a new feature called Container Queries, which allows
us to style components based on their container size.

You may be wondering, “Hasan we already have media queries!”. And you are right of course, but 
media queries are based on the viewport size, and with how you can have your component anywhere 
wouldn't it be nice if your component could be aware of its container size and adjust accordingly?
And all that without a single line of JS? Now that I have your attention (hopefully), let's dive in.


## How and When to use Container Queries

Below I am rendering a simple ManagerCard component that we use in bunch of places in [Sematext](https://sematext.com/).
This is a simplified version of the original component.
