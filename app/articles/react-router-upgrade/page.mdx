# Upgrading React Router from v3 to v6

We all know it is important to keep our dependencies upto date specially when it comes to
the ever changing world of Javascript, but there is always a deadline hanging over your head
or the current package is working fine so why bother upgrading it.

Something like this happened to us in [Sematext](https://sematext.com/) and we kept delaying
upgrade of React Router. We were still using React Router version 3 while 6 came out with
bunch of enticing features. To give you some context: Router v3.0.0 came out late 2016
and v6.0.0 came out in late 2021!

By mid 2022 we decided that it was high time we upgraded and I like our readers decided to google
how to upgrade from v3 to v6. But all articles I found were focused on upgrading it from v4/5 to v6.
Of course who would be crazy enough to upgrade from v3 to v6 ðŸ˜…. This is partly the reason I wanted
to write this article so I can share what its like upgrading a complex app from v3 to v6 and how to
solve the problems you might face.
