      <p className="my-4">
        I am an experienced web developer who has built apps ranging from
        enterprise level apps to small pet projects like this cv-app. Over the
        years I have mastered all major frontend frameworks (React, Angular,
        Vue) and have built complex backend apps using multiple frameworks
        (Laravel, Express).
      </p>
      <p className="my-4">
        But what sets me apart is not my technical knowledge but my attitude
        towards web development. I was not forced on this line, in fact I chose
        this field after trying other things out. Because of which I have a
        certain passion for my job which differentiates me from many other
        developers out there.
      </p>
      <p className="my-4">
        I have had the privilege of being part of and leading amazing developers
        and managers. Having worked with remote teams spread all across the
        world I am well suited to the handle the unique challenges of
        distributed multi-cultural teams. Also having worked as the lead
        front-end developer has taught me the required balance between business
        and technical demands of any product.
