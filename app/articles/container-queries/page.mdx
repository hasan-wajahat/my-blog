# Container Queries

As the web has evolved, we have moved to using more and more components. Be it
Frontend frameworks like React or Svelte, or templating languages like laravel Blade; all of them
depend on the concept of components. These components can be used inside dialogs, split-screens or
the main content area, meaning their size requirements can vary widely. Luckily for us, CSS has
caught up with this trend and has introduced a new feature called Container Queries, which allows
us to style components based on their container size.

You may be wondering, “Hasan we already have media queries!”. And you are right of course, but
media queries are based on the viewport size, and with how you can have your component anywhere
wouldn't it be nice if your component could be aware of its container size and adjust accordingly?
And all that without a single line of JS? Now that I have your attention (hopefully), let's dive in.

## How and When to use Container Queries

Below I am rendering a simple ManagerCard component that we use in bunch of places in [Sematext](https://sematext.com/).
This is a simplified (and cruder) version of the original component.

<ManagerCard />
<figcaption>
  With MDX I can render the component instead of using an image.
</figcaption>

The component can be rendered in different places on our site as shown below:

<figure>
  <Image src={inMainPageImage} alt="ManagerCard in main page" />
  <figcaption>ManagerCard in main page</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
  <Image src={inFlyoutImage} alt="ManagerCard in flyout" />
  <figcaption>ManagerCard in flyout</figcaption>
</figure>

Before I introduced container queries, we had to pass additional props like “minimal” to the
component to adjust its sizing depending on where it was rendered. And this could become overly
complex as we we continue to add it in different places. This becomes worse when you consider smaller
screens like tablets.

But with container queries it did not matter where this component is used. It will automatically adjust
its styling based on space available. This allows use to get rid of the additional props and makes the
component more reusable and easier to maintain.
